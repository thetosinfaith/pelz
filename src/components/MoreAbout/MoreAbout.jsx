              I have worn a lot of hats. And considering the size of my head, I
              think they are a little too many. Right now, I'm a web dev
              completely sold out to designing and building professional,
              beautiful websites you'll love.

            <p>
              I’m currently studying Accounting, a 5 - year course. Sometimes, I
              spend most of my time figuring out why the debit and credit side
              of an accout sheet is not balancing.

            <p>
              I’m not a conventional speaker, and I never will be. I don’t talk
              about strategies - I show you how to apply them. I always have so
              much to say on:
